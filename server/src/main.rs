//! Main server driver for the project. Maintains controller connections via web-socket and can
//! connect them to active web sessions. Aside from that however the only other thing managed by
//! the site itself is *what* game the controller is currently in (there is no user data, all is
//! linked and contained via controller). The game logic itself is handled in WASM on the frontend
